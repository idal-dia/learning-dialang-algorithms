# Learning how to build Dialang

This repo contains implementations of various algorithms that will become parts of [Dialang](https://github.com/dialogue-host/dialang). I follow different articles and conferences to build confidence by implementing increasingly intricate and complete versions of these algorithms.

The following files are organized by increasing complexity.

## Parser

- Lexer/IntMath.elm
- Parser/ShuntingYard.elm
- Lexer/Base.elm

## Type Checker

## Interaction Calculus (IC) Target

- IC/Basic.elm
- IC/Chruch.elm
- IC/HVM2.elm
